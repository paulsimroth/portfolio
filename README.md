# Portfolio Page

This is my repo of what will be my new portfolio page.
After staying with my first portfolio page for a while I decided it would be time to change to something more fitting for showcasing the knowledge and experience I gained since I made my first portfolio page.

I use Next.Js and Tailwind for styling and Framer Motion for the animations.

This page is an ongoing project and I will also use this page to try out new things.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (Frontend Framework)
